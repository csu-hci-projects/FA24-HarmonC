## Overview
This is a first person shooter game developed in Unreal Engine 5. It features 3 unique levels, hazards, targets, and health and ammo pickups. User UI is also implemented.

2.Record a 5-10 minute video showcasing the features above. You must demonstrate how each feature works while running the game and show the event graph (blueprint “code”). This video needs to be uploaded to YouTube UNLISTED. That link must be turned in on the associated assignment Canvas page. It is your responsibility that it works.

3. Record a longer video where you explain all your blueprints. This will also be YouTube unlisted.

4. Please feel free to use LLMs (e.g., Chat GPT) to help or the web. Please write a document of what you used beyond the class. This part will not be graded but saved as you need it for your AI report. A PDF file of this will be required to be uploaded.
Most of my help came from Teams or the Lab Videos. I did use ChatGPT however to figure out how to write a ReadMe File and it also recommended to me the node Get Current Level name to fix my UI issue.
